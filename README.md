# Closet-Org
I used a python based AI specific programing language called PyTorch in order to orginize clothes while only using an image of the clothing.  
I plan to use this Artificial Inteligence to create an app that can help you orginize your closet. 
The first feature is this AI.  It would allow you to take a picture of your new clothes and upload them to a drive that stores your clothes information. (your virtual closet)
The second feature of this program is the inventory feature.  I want this app to create an inventory that tracks what you have worn and if it has been washed or not.
I also want to create a seprate AI that automatically creates outfits that matches and looks good through color theory and style guides that have been preuploded.  This would most likely be the hardest part of the app but i am currently working on the AI behind it.
